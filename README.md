# MiniBash
*Description:*
Developed a custom shell named Shell24, resembling basic functionalities of the Bash shell. Leveraged low-level system programming techniques including fork(), exec(), dup(), dup2(), read(), and write() system calls to implement command execution, input/output redirection, and process management.

*Key Contributions:*
- Implemented a shell interpreter capable of executing commands entered by the user, reflecting proficiency in C programming and system calls.
- Employed tokenization techniques to parse user input, demonstrating strong understanding of string manipulation and parsing.
- Utilized process management techniques such as forking and waiting to ensure proper execution and termination of child processes.
- Accomplished redirection of input/output streams, showcasing expertise in file descriptors manipulation.
- Ensured user-friendly interaction by providing a command prompt, handling command execution errors, and gracefully terminating the shell upon user request.

*Technologies and Skills Demonstrated:*
- C programming language
- Low-level system programming
- Process management
- Input/output redirection
- Error handling
- Tokenization and parsing
- Unix system calls (fork(), exec(), dup(), dup2(), read(), write())
- Shell scripting

*Future Improvements:*
- Enhance functionality by implementing features such as piping, background processing, and signal handling.
- Improve error reporting and handling to provide more informative feedback to users.
- Expand compatibility and robustness by considering edge cases and handling exceptions effectively.

*Conclusion:*
Shell24 represents a significant project showcasing proficiency in low-level system programming and command execution. This project underscores my ability to develop efficient and functional software solutions, as well as my strong understanding of Unix-based systems and programming languages.
